![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itBunHop/BunTheme/main/Graphics/logo%20(doubleres).png)
a notITG theme

## features
my friends have told me to get it working functionally and work on visuals later so right now it features

- more fonts
- reformatting of various screens to use less of metrics.ini (hopefully, theming is kind of not good)
    - ScreenEvaluationStage
    - ScreenSelectMusic (i might need metrics here though)
- some visuals are currently from Simply Love, will hope to figure out what to do with replacing
- minimal combo explosions and no event text


## feedback and helping
bun is currently the only one developing on this
