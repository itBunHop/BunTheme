# BunTheme
(placeholder name)

a notITG theme

## features
my friends have told me to get it working functionally and work on visuals later so right now it features

- more fonts
- reformatting of various screens to use less of metrics.ini (hopefully, theming is kind of not good)
    - ScreenEvaluationStage
    - ScreenSelectMusic
- some visuals are currently from Simply Love, will hope to figure out what to do with replacing
- minimal combo explosions and no event text

## features hopefully to implement
- better options
- judgment fonts (i guess)
- ScreenGameplay interface for non mods
- suggest warnings on various files for problems such as loud volume or epilepsy and taking breaks


## feedback and helping
bun is currently the only one developing on this

you might like to offer help or feedback on this theme
